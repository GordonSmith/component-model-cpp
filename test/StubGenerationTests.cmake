# ===== WIT Stub Generation and Validation =====
# This module generates C++ stubs from WIT test files and compiles them to validate
# the code generation pipeline (grammar -> parser -> codegen -> compilation)
#
# Requirements:
# - BUILD_GRAMMAR=ON (for wit-codegen tool)
# - wit-codegen target must exist
# - Python 3 (for stub generation script)
#
# Provides:
# - generate-test-stubs: Generate stubs from all WIT test files
# - validate-test-stubs: Compile generated stubs to verify code generation
# - test-stubs-full: Combined generation + validation

# Only proceed if grammar/codegen tools are available
