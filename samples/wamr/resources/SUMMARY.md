# WAMR Resource Examples Summary

This directory contains comprehensive examples and tests for WebAssembly Component Model resource management in C++.

## 📁 Files Overview

### Core Examples
- **`simple_resource_demo.cpp`** - Complete standalone demonstration of resource concepts
- **`resource_examples.cpp`** - Advanced examples with WAMR integration patterns
- **`build.sh`** - Simple build script for compiling examples independently

### Documentation
- **`README.md`** - Detailed guide and API reference
- **`CMakeLists.txt`** - CMake configuration for integrated builds

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to the resource examples directory
cd samples/wamr/resources

# Build and run all tests
./build.sh test

# Or build and run individual examples
./build.sh simple
./simple-demo

# Run specific test categories
./simple-demo --basic      # Basic resource operations
./simple-demo --table      # Resource table management
./simple-demo --canon      # Canon resource functions
./simple-demo --lift-lower # Lift/lower operations
```

## 🎯 What These Examples Demonstrate

### 1. **Resource Type System**
- `own_t<T>` vs `borrow_t<T>` semantics
- Move-only vs copy behavior
- Resource type traits and concepts

### 2. **Resource Lifecycle Management**
- Resource creation with destructors
- Proper cleanup on scope exit
- Ownership transfer semantics

### 3. **Resource Tables**
- Handle allocation and management
- Type-safe resource retrieval
- Handle reuse (free list functionality)

### 4. **Component Model ABI**
- Canon resource functions (stub implementations)
- Lift/lower operations for serialization
- Memory store/load operations

### 5. **Integration Patterns**
- Host function definitions that use resources
- Resource composition in complex functions
- Error handling with invalid resources

## 📊 Test Coverage

These examples provide comprehensive coverage of the resource functionality tested in our test suite:

| Feature | Example Coverage | Test Coverage |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| Own/Borrow Types | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| Resource Tables | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| Move/Copy Semantics | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| Destructors | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| Canon Functions | ✅ Stubs | ✅ Stubs |
| Lift/Lower Ops | ✅ Stubs | ✅ Stubs |
| Type Safety | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| Error Handling | ✅ Partial | ✅ Full |

## 🔧 Implementation Status

### ✅ **Fully Implemented**
- Resource type system (`own_t`, `borrow_t`, `ResourceType`)
- Resource table with handle management
- Type safety and concepts
- Basic memory operations
- Move/copy semantics
- Synchronous destructors

### ⚠️ **Stub Implementation**
- Canon ABI functions (work for testing, need full implementation)
- Lift/lower operations (interface ready, stub behavior)
- Memory store/load (basic implementation)

### ❌ **Future Implementation**
- Full guest memory integration
- Async destructor support
- Cross-instance resource management
- Component instance lifecycle integration

## 📈 Relationship to Reference Tests

These examples directly correspond to the Python reference implementation:
- **Python**: `ref/component-model/design/mvp/canonical-abi/run_tests.py` (`test_handles()`)
- **C++ Tests**: `test/resource_tests.cpp` (comprehensive test suite)
- **C++ Examples**: These samples (practical demonstrations)

The examples demonstrate the same core concepts but in a more accessible, tutorial-like format.

## 🔮 Next Steps

1. **Full ABI Implementation**: Replace stub implementations with complete Component Model compliance
2. **WAMR Integration**: Add actual WebAssembly guest interaction
3. **Async Support**: Implement async destructors and resource operations
4. **Performance**: Optimize for high-frequency resource operations

## 🎓 Educational Value

These examples serve as:
- **Learning Tool**: For understanding Component Model resource concepts
- **Reference Implementation**: Showing best practices for resource management
- **Integration Guide**: Demonstrating how to use resources in real applications
- **Test Validation**: Ensuring our implementation works as expected

The progression from simple concepts to complex scenarios makes these examples ideal for both learning the Component Model and validating implementation correctness.
