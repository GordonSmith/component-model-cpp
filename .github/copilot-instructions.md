## Repository focus
- Header-only C++20 implementation of the WebAssembly Component Model canonical ABI; public surface aggregates through `include/cmcpp.hpp` and the `cmcpp` namespace.
- Core work revolves around marshaling values between C++ types and wasm flat values using `lift_flat`, `lower_flat`, `lift_flat_values`, and `lower_flat_values` templates.
- Project is kept in sync with the upstream spec (`ref/component-model`) and the reference Python definitions (`definitions.py`, `run_tests.py`). Compare against those when adjusting ABI semantics.

## Core headers
- `include/cmcpp/traits.hpp` defines `ValTrait`, type aliases (e.g., `bool_t`, `string_t`), and concept shortcuts that every new type must implement.
- `include/cmcpp/context.hpp` + `InstanceContext` encapsulate guest memory (`std::span<uint8_t>`), realloc callbacks, and host traps; use `createInstanceContext` before calling lift/lower helpers.
- Memory helpers live in `include/cmcpp/load.hpp`/`store.hpp`; always respect `ValTrait<T>::size` and `alignment` from those headers instead of hard-coding layout rules.

## Lift/Lower workflow
- `lower_flat_values` flattens function arguments, auto-switching to heap marshalling when the arity exceeds `MAX_FLAT_PARAMS`; `lift_flat_values` mirrors this when decoding results.
- Heap-based lowering uses `cx.opts.realloc` to allocate guest memory; make sure any caller populates `LiftLowerOptions` with a working realloc when passing heap-backed types (lists, strings, large tuples).
- String conversions rely on the `convert` callback; tests wire this through ICU (`test/host-util.cpp`). Preserve the encoding enum contract (`Encoding::Utf8`, `Encoding::Utf16`, `Encoding::Latin1`, `Encoding::Latin1_Utf16`).

## Adding types or functions
- Extend `ValTrait` specializations and `ValTrait<T>::flat_types` for new composite types before touching lift/lower logic.
- Use concepts from `traits.hpp` (e.g., `List`, `Variant`, `Flags`) so overload resolution stays consistent; mirror patterns in `include/cmcpp/list.hpp`, `variant.hpp`, etc.
- Guard traps with `trap_if(cx, condition, message)` and route all host failures through the `HostTrap` provided by the context rather than throwing ad-hoc exceptions.

## Testing
- Default build enables coverage flags on GCC/Clang; run `cmake --preset linux-ninja-Debug` followed by `cmake --build --preset linux-ninja-Debug` and then `ctest --preset linux-ninja-Debug` (or `ctest -VV` from the build tree).
- C++ tests live in `test/main.cpp` using doctest and ICU for encoding checks; keep new tests near related sections for quick discovery.
- `run_tests.py` exercises the same ABI rules via Pythonâ€”use it to cross-check tricky canonical ABI edge cases when changing flattening behavior.

## Samples & runtimes
- Enabling `-DBUILD_SAMPLES=ON` builds the WAMR host sample (`samples/wamr`); it wraps host callbacks with `host_function`/`guest_function` helpers defined in `include/wamr.hpp`.
- Sample guest wasm artifacts are generated from `wasm/test.wit` via `wit-bindgen` and `wasm-tools`. The `samples/CMakeLists.txt` external project expects `WASI_SDK_PREFIX` to point at the vcpkg-installed WASI SDK.
- `wasm/build.sh` spins up a dev container to compile wasm components reproducibly; run it if you need to refresh the sample binaries.

## Tooling notes
- Dependencies are managed through `vcpkg.json` with overlays in `vcpkg_overlays/` (notably for WAMR); stick with preset builds so CMake wires in the correct toolchain file automatically.
- Cargo manifest (`Cargo.toml`) is only for fetching `wasm-tools` and `wit-bindgen-cli`; if you touch wasm generation logic, update both the manifest and any scripts referencing those versions.
- Keep documentation alongside code: update `README.md` when introducing new host types or workflows so downstream integrators stay aligned with the canonical ABI behavior.
